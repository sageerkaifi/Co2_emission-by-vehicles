# CO2 Emissions by Vehicles Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing CO2 emissions from vehicles to understand the factors influencing emissions and to provide insights for reducing environmental impact. The dataset includes various vehicle attributes such as engine size, fuel type, and fuel consumption, which are used to predict and analyze CO2 emissions.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: Visualizations and statistical analysis to explore relationships between vehicle features and CO2 emissions.
- **Regression Modeling**: Predictive models to estimate CO2 emissions based on vehicle characteristics.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Actionable insights to help reduce emissions and promote sustainable transportation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

## Dataset
The dataset includes information such as:
- Engine size
- Cylinders
- Fuel type (e.g., gasoline, diesel, hybrid)
- Fuel consumption (city, highway, combined)
- CO2 emissions

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/sageerkaifi/Co2_emission-by-vehicles)
